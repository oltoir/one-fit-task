# 1FIT Frontend Developer Challenge - Job listings with filtering

![Design preview for the Job listings with filtering coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. At the end we'd prefer to see running demo (it'd be great if you can deploy it to somewhere like Github pages & share a URL with us).

You can use any tools & frameworks you like to help you complete the challenge, as long as it's built with **React.js** & has a high code quality.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories. 

### Filtering

Use the [data.json](one-fit-app/data.json) file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content. You can directly add this to your app or use it as a remote data-source, whichever you please.

To add a filter, the user needs to click on a tag (visible at the right side of listing on Desktops, and visible below listing on mobile devices). Filters work as an "AND" function, i.e. only display the listings that has the all selected filters.

Users should be able to remove a filter by clicking [ X ], next to the filter in the selected filters list.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. Please look at the figma file for the additional details.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as fonts.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
